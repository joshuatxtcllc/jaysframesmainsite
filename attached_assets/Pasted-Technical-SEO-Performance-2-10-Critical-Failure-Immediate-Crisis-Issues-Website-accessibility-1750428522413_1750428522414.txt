Technical SEO Performance: 2/10 (Critical Failure)
Immediate Crisis Issues:
	•	Website accessibility blocked - robots.txt preventing search engine crawling
	•	Loading performance failures - site stalls during load attempts (30+ seconds)
	•	Mobile responsiveness gaps - not optimized for mobile-first indexing
	•	Core Web Vitals failure - performance issues impacting user experience
The technical foundation is fundamentally broken. Search engines cannot crawl the site, making all other SEO efforts meaningless.  Industry standards require loading times under 3 seconds, yet the site fails to load consistently. 
Critical Actions Required:
	•	Remove robots.txt blocking immediately
	•	Migrate to reliable hosting with CDN implementation
	•	Implement mobile-first responsive design
	•	Optimize images and compress assets for sub-3-second loading
	•	Add HTTPS security and proper canonical tags
Website Structure & Navigation: 4/10 (Poor)
Current State Analysis:
Basic website architecture exists but suffers from poor organization and technical implementation. The site lacks clear service categorization and intuitive user journeys that competitors like FastFrame Houston execute effectively. 
Structural Weaknesses:
	•	No clear service-specific landing pages
	•	Missing internal linking strategy
	•	Poor URL structure (likely generic rather than descriptive)
	•	Inadequate breadcrumb navigation
	•	Limited site hierarchy for easy browsing
Improvement Strategy:
Create dedicated pages for “Custom Framing Houston,” “Shadow Box Creation,” “Art Installation Services,” and “Museum Quality Framing” with proper internal linking between related services. 
Page Load Speed & Core Web Vitals: 1/10 (Failing)
Performance Crisis:
Website loading failures represent the most critical barrier to user engagement and search engine indexing. This single issue eliminates potential for ranking in local search results where competitors dominate.
Expected Metrics After Optimization:
	•	Largest Contentful Paint (LCP): Target under 2.5 seconds
	•	First Input Delay (FID): Target under 100 milliseconds
	•	Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS): Target under 0.1 
Implementation Priority:
High-performance hosting, image optimization for framing portfolio showcases, and technical audit addressing server response times must be completed within 30 days.
Mobile Responsiveness & UX: 3/10 (Inadequate)
Mobile Experience Gaps:
With 62% of e-commerce occurring on mobile devices,  the current mobile experience fails to capture local customers searching for “custom framing near me” while commuting or at client locations.
Critical Mobile Features Missing:
	•	Click-to-call functionality for immediate quotes
	•	Touch-friendly gallery browsing for frame selection
	•	Mobile-optimized contact forms
	•	Responsive image galleries showcasing work quality
Competitive Context:
FastFrame Houston and Village Frame Gallery provide superior mobile experiences,  capturing market share from mobile-first local searches. 
Content Quality & AEO Readiness: 4/10 (Below Standard)
Content Strategy Weaknesses:
The site lacks the question-and-answer content format essential for Answer Engine Optimization. Customers frequently ask specific questions about framing costs, timelines, and processes that competitors address effectively.  
Missing AEO Content Opportunities:
	•	“How much does custom framing cost in Houston?” (high-volume search)
	•	“What’s the difference between preservation and regular framing?”
	•	“How long does custom framing take?”
	•	“Best custom framing Heights Houston” (local advantage opportunity)
Content Development Priority:
Create comprehensive FAQ section, service-specific educational content, and local Houston neighborhood targeting pages to capture AEO traffic.
