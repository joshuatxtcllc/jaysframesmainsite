## Recent Changes

### March 23, 2025
1. Added OpenAI API key to environment secrets
2. Updated frame-assistant-test.tsx with proper type definitions
3. Updated server/ai.ts to use the newer GPT-4o model
4. Fixed API integration to properly handle responses
5. Successfully tested the Frame Design Assistant API endpoint
6. Created this development log for reference

## Potential Issues to Watch For
1. Type errors in storage.ts related to optional vs. required fields
2. Date handling in the storage implementation (string vs. Date type)
3. Error handling in the AI integration could be improved for more specific error messages
4. Need to keep an eye on the OpenAI API usage and rate limits

## Next Steps
1. Implement more extensive error handling for API requests
2. Add authentication for admin features
3. Enhance the Frame Designer with visual previews
4. Implement payment processing integration
5. Add user accounts and order history
